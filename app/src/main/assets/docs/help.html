<h3>Practicing vocabulary</h3>

<p>When a vocabulary word is presented to you, try to recall what the meaning and pronunciation is. Then click the button to show the answer. You will be presented with six response buttons numbered 0-5. These are the meanings:</p>

<ul>
    <li>5 - You got the answer right. It was easy.</li><br>
    <li>4 - You got the answer right, but recalling it took a slight hesitation.</li><br>
    <li>3 - You got the answer right, but recalling it took considerable effort.</li><br>
    <li>2 - You got the answer wrong, but when you saw the right answer you thought, "Oh, of course. I know that! How did I miss that?"</li><br>
    <li>1 - You got the answer wrong, but when you saw the right answer you remembered learning it before.</li><br>
    <li>0 - You didn't know the answer at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your response, the app will select a future date for you to review the vocabulary item. The easier it is, the less often you need to review it. Difficult items, on the other hand, you will need to practice frequently. This is known as spaced repetition and this app uses the SuperMemo (SM-2) learning algorithm for scheduling the spaced repetition.</p>

<h3>Editing words and lists</h3>

<p>You can add, edit, and delete words and lists from the menu options. When in the Lists view, you can get more options by long clicking a list name.</p>

<h3>Importing and exporting</h3>

<p>It is a good idea to export your list to your SD card every now and then. After exporting, you will find it in the Suryaa folder. From there you can save it to a computer for safekeeping.</p>

<p>If you want to create your list on a computer and then import it into Suryaa, you can create a CSV (comma separated values) text file. Each line should be have four parts like the following:</p>

<p>"mongol text","English meaning","pronunciation","audio file name"</p>

<p>For example:</p><p>"ᠰᠤᠷᠤᠶ᠎ᠠ","let's study","sʊrjaː","suryaa.mp3"</p>

<p>It is ok to leave one of the items blank, but you still need to include the comma and quotes.</p>

<p>"ᠰᠤᠷᠤᠶ᠎ᠠ","let's study","",""</p>

<p>If you are including audio files, they should be in the same folder as the CVS file.</p>
